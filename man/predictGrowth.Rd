\usage{
predictGrowth(
  genes,
  highly_expressed,
  metagenome = FALSE,
  temperature = "none"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genes}{DNAStringSet object holding all nucleotide sequences from a
genome.}

\item{highly_expressed}{Logical vector describing the set of highly expressed
genes. Must be of same lend as \code{genes}.}

\item{metagenome}{Whether to run prediction in metagenome mode (no codon pair
bias)}

\item{temperature}{Optimal growth temperature. By default this is set as
"none" and we do not guarantee good results for non-mesophilic organisms.}
}
\value{
gRodon returns a list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{CUBHE}{Median codon usage bias of the highly expressed genes (MILC)
calculated using the genome-wide codon usage as the expected bias}
\item{ConsistencyHE}{Median codon usage bias of the highly expressed genes
(MILC) calculated using the codon usage of highly expressed genes as the
expected bias}
\item{CPB}{Genome-wide codon pair bias (Coleman et al. 2008)}
\item{FilteredSequences}{Number of gene sequences filtered out during
calulation (due to length and/or presence of ambiguous bases)}
\item{d}{Predicted doubling time}
\item{LowerCI}{Lower CI of \code{d} (2.5\%)}
\item{UpperCI}{Upper CI of \code{d} (97.5\%)}
}
}
\description{
This function predicts the growth rate of a prokaryotic organism based on
genomic codon usage patterns (Weissman et. al. TBD).

\examples{
# Load in example genome (Streptococcus pyogenes M1, downloaded from RefSeq)
# included with gRodon
path_to_genome <- system.file('extdata',
  'GCF_000349925.2_ASM34992v2_cds_from_genomic.fna',
  package = 'gRodon')
genes <- readDNAStringSet(path_to_genome)

# Search pre-existing annotations for ribosomal proteins, which we
# will use as our set of highly expressed genes
highly_expressed <- grepl("ribosomal protein",names(genes),ignore.case = T)

# Run the gRodon growth prediction pipeline
predictGrowth(genes, highly_expressed)

# Run gRodon with temperature option (not needed for mesophiles, gRodon not
# validated on extremophiles, use with care)
predictGrowth(genes, highly_expressed, temperature = 37)
